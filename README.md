An econometrics project 
In this project, which is an econometric project from the book Introduction to Economics by Stock/Watson, there is a dataset containing economic data of 65 countries to investigate the factors affecting their economic growth. This project has been investigated with the help of linear regression machine learning model, where X is the independent variable and Y, which is the growth column and represents the economic growth of the countries, is the dependent variable or our target.
